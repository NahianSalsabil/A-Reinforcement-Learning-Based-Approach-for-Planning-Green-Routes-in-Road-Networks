Urbanization has necessitated sustainable routing solutions, yet current route optimization algorithms often ignore environmental and human well-being factors. This work introduces the Green Route Optimization problem, focusing on finding the route with the minimum air and noise pollution and the maximum urban green space within a travel distance constraint. People would be happy to travel a bit more if, in return, they can enjoy cleaner environments with less pollution. 

Green routes are crucial for sustainable urban development and public health. Although recent works have considered environmental factors, they typically focus on a single aspect (i.e., air pollution). These approaches use traditional route planning algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and A* that are not suitable for dynamic contexts with frequently changing environmental conditions. Using reinforcement learning, our approach adapts to real-time environmental changes, balancing environmental factors (i.e., air and noise pollution and green urban space) with travel efficiency. 

The key idea behind the effectiveness of our reinforcement learning based solution is our novel reward function that simultaneously considers the environmental factors and travel distance, and significantly enhance the quality of green routes. Our extensive experiment with real datasets show that our green routes reduces the pollution level and increases the green space with a reasonable increase of the travel distance.
