# RL Based Approach to Plan Green Routes in Road Networks
The Green Route Problem aims to find optimal travel paths that minimize nega-
tive environmental impacts while still meeting practical constraints of travel distance. In this
context, we focus on three critical aspects:
- **Air Pollution:** By selecting routes that minimize exposure to high-pollution areas, we can con-
tribute to cleaner air and better health outcomes.
- **Noise Pollution:** Noise pollution from traffic affects both physical health and mental well-
being. By avoiding noisy routes, we can reduce noise exposure for commuters.
- **Green Spaces:** Urban green spaces help mitigate pollution, reduce heat island
effects, and enhance overall well-being. Incorporating green spaces into route planning
can lead to a more sustainable urban environment.


The key idea behind the effectiveness of our reinforcement learning based solution is our novel reward function that simultaneously considers multiple environmental factors and travel distance, and significantly enhance the quality of green routes. Our extensive experiment with real datasets show that our green routes reduces the pollution level and increases the green space with a reasonable increase of the travel distance.
