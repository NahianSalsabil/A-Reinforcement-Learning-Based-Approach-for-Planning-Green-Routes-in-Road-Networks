Urbanization has necessitated sustainable routing solutions, yet current route optimiza-
tion algorithms often ignore environmental and human well-being factors. The thesis intro-
duces the Green Route Optimization problem, focusing on finding the route with the min-
imum air and noise pollution and the maximum urban green space within a travel distance
constraint. People would be happy to travel a bit more if, in return, they can enjoy cleaner
environments with less pollution. Green routes are crucial for sustainable urban develop-
ment and public health. Although recent works have considered environmental factors,
they typically focus on a single aspect (i.e., air pollution). These approaches use traditional
route planning algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and A* that are not suitable for dynamic contexts
with frequently changing environmental conditions. Using reinforcement learning, our ap-
proach adapts to real-time environmental changes, balancing environmental factors (i.e., air
and noise pollution and green urban space) with travel efficiency. The key idea behind the
effectiveness of our reinforcement learning based solution is our novel reward function that
simultaneously considers the environmental factors and travel distance, and significantly
enhance the quality of green routes. Our extensive experiment with real datasets show that
our green routes reduces the pollution level and increases the green space with a reasonable
increase of the travel distance.
